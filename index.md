# About me.

My name is Ben Listyg. Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student studying Industrial-Organizational (I-O) Psychology at the University of Georgia advised by Dr. Nathan Carter. My substantive research interests primarily revolve around vocational interests and occupational choice. Methodologically, I am interested in item response theory, applied graph theory, and mixed effect models.

Prior to my return to academia, I was a member of the Data Team at Wyzant, an online tutor marketplace based in Chicago, IL, between March 2018 and June 2019. At Wyzant, I worked on interesting problems at the intersection of natural language processing and graph theory (with some observational causal inference problems thrown in there as well).

I have previously worked at National Public Radio, Mercer Consulting, Junior Achievement of Georgia, and Invesco. I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Georgia in 2016. Additionally, I spent some time at Georgia Tech as a visiting research assistant in the summer of 2014 and was a PhD student in the I-O department at the University of South Florida between 2016 and 2017 before leaving to explore a career path in industry.
